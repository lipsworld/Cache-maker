Cache-maker
===========

Wordpress has a nice variety of plugins that cache the page content. These pages expire after some time. Also they are created only when a visitor comes to the site for the first time, if the page was not cached before.
That means, that the visitor will have to a bit for the page to get cached and displayed. Why let him wait?
